NAME
    WWW::Mixpanel

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
      use WWW::Mixpanel;
      my $mp = WWW::Mixpanel->new( '1827378adad782983249287292a', 1 );
      $mp->track(event => 'login', distinct_id => 'username', mp_source => 'twitter');

DESCRIPTION
    The WWW::Mixpanel module is a young implementation of the
    <http://mixpanel.com> API which provides realtime online analytics.
    Mixpanel.com receives events from your application's perl code,
    javascript, email open and click tracking, and many more sources, and
    provides visualization and publishing of analytics.

    Currently, this module mirrors the event tracking API
    (<http://mixpanel.com/api/docs/specification>), and can be extended to
    include the powerful data access and platform parts of the api. FEATURE
    REQUESTS are always welcome, as are patches.

    This module is designed to croak on failure, please use something like
    Try::Tiny.

METHODS
  new( $token, [$use_ssl] )
    Returns a new instance of this class. You must supply the API token for
    your mixpanel project. HTTP is used to connect unless you provide a true
    value for use_ssl.

  track( event => '<event name>', [time => timestamp, ...])
    Send an event to the API with the given event name, which is a required
    parameter. If you do not include a time parameter, the value of time()
    is set for you automatically. Other parameters are optional, and are
    included as-is as parameters in the api.

    Today, there is no way to set 'URL' parameters such as ip, callback,
    img, redirect.

    This method returns 1 or croaks with a message. Per the Mixpanel API, a
    1 return indicates the event reached the mixpanel.com API and was
    properly formatted. 1 does not indicate the event was actually written
    to your project, in cases such as bad API token. This is a limitation of
    the service.

    You are strongly encouraged to use something like "Try::Tiny" to wrap
    calls to this API.

TODO
    /track to accept array of events
        Track will shortly be extended to accept an array of hashrefs. These
        will be sent as a batch of events to the /track API in a single bulk
        call. This will greatly help you if you are able to pull multiple
        events from a queue.

    /platform support
        The Platform API will be supported. Let me know if this is a feature
        you'd like to use.

FEATURE REQUESTS
    Please send feature requests to me via rt or email. Patches are always
    welcome.

AFFILIATION
    I am not affiliated with mixpanel, I just use and like the service.
